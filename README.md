  File name: 
    * For a source file containing classes, the file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class (of which there is exactly one), plus the .java extension.
    * One class for a file
  Imports:
    * no wildcard imports 
  Class declaration
    * Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.
    
  Naming
    * Package and module names: com.example.deepspace (all lower case letters)
    * Class names/ Enums are also classes: UpperCamelCase
    * Method names: lowerCamelCase
    * Constant names: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    * Non-constant field names/ Parameter names/ Local variable names: lowerCamelCase
    * Type variable names: followed by the capital letter T (examples: RequestT, FooBarT).
